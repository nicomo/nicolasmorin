With the caveat that my last.fm account was disconnected in April and I didn't realize it before the beginning of May, I have a few stats about the music I listened to in 2018:

- 3,645 tracks, some multiple times: 6,245 listens.
- that amounted to 15 days and 4 hours of music
- 690 different artists, of which 66% were artists I hadn't listened to before
- 971 different albums (84% new)

My top albums were:

1. Mndsgn — Yawn Zen
1. Dan Auerbach — Waiting on a Song ⭐
1. Samiyam — Pizza Party
1. Chicano Batman — Freedom Is Free	
1. Wajatta — Casual High Technology	
1. Anderson .Paak — Oxnard
1. Kronos Quartet — Landfall ⭐
1. Dan Auerbach — Keep It Hid ⭐
1. Nick Drake — Pink Moon ⭐
1. Rejoicer — Energy Dreams
1. DANGERDOOM — The Mouse and the Mask 
1. GZA/Genius — Pro Tools
1. Roy Hargrove — Earfood
1. Paul McCartney — Back In The U.S.
1. Mayer Hawthorne — A Strange Arrangement
1. Gal Costa — India ⭐
1. Paul McCartney — McCartney 
1. Ondatrópica — Baile Bucanero	
1. Japanese Breakfast — Soft Sounds From Another Planet
1. Nai Palm — Needle Paw ⭐

Funny thing is these albums are not necessarily those I prefered. Hence the star next to those I did in fact prefer.

As far as genres are concerned I seem to have split pretty evenly between jazz, rock, hip-hop, world and classical.

Dan Auerbach was the artist of my 2018. If I add to his solo albums those he did as a member of The Black Keys or The Arcs, he's the runaway leader of my playlist... Listen to Dan Auerback, people! There's something at once modern and timeless about his music, it's got to be good for the soul. And even though his _Waiting on a Song_ album was released in 2017, it's still the best album I listened to in 2018.
